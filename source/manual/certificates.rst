==================
Trust
==================

In PFWsense, certificates are used for ensuring trust between peers. To make using them easier, PFWsense allows creating
certificates from the front-end. In addition to that, it also allows creating certificates for other purposes,
avoiding the need to use the ``openssl`` command line tool. Certificates in PFWsense can be managed from
:menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Certificates`.

Examples of PFWsense components that use certificates:

* OpenVPN
* IPsec
* Captive Portal
* Web Proxy

---------------------
Certificate types
---------------------

The following types of certificate can be generated in PFWsense:

* Client
* Server
* Combined Client/Server
* Certificate Authority

In addition to this, PFWsense can generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). This can be used if you want to create a
certficate signed by an external CA.

.. warning::

    Make sure that you select the correct certificate type, as many clients will refuse connection (or at least show
    errors) if an incorrect certificate type is used. For example, you can use either a server certificate or a
    combined client/server certificate to secure the connection to the web interface, but not a CA or client certificate.


---------------------
Revoke certificates
---------------------

............................................
Certificate Revocation Lists
............................................

A Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) is a list of certificates that have been revoked by the certificate authority.
Some services in PFWsense can use these to validate if a certificate is still valid to use even though it might not
be expired.

Defining a CRL in PFWsense is not very complicated, just go to :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Revocation`
and click on the [+] sign for your (local) certficate authority to create a new CRL. When a CRL exists, you may
edit it and add or remove certificates in it (using the pencil icon).

.. Note::

    .. raw:: html

        If you wish to use a CRL for external tools you can download it using the  <i class="fa fa-download fa-fw"></i>  button


One of the downsides of a CRL is that they don't scale very well, each consumer of the list should download the full list in
order to know if a certificate can still be trusted. Information often is less accurate as these lists usually
are only generated on certain intervals.

When using a CRL for a local authority on PFWsense itself the scaling part usually isn't a large issue as
the number of certificates is usually limited (for example to the number of employees in your organisation).

To manually verify the created certificates using :code:`openssl` commands, you need the following ingredients:

1.  The CA certificate chain which signed the certificates (export "cert" from Authorities menu)
2.  The CRL created in PFWsense (export "crl" from Revocation menu)
3.  A revoked certificate (export "cert" from Certificates menu)
4.  A non expired or revoked certificate

First we concatenate both the CA chain and the CRL into a single "chain" file:

::

    # cat ca_chain.crt ca_crl.crl > my_chain.pem

Then validate a revoked certificate using the following :code:`openssl` command:

::

    # openssl verify -crl_check -CAfile my_chain.pem revoked_cert.crt
    C=NL, CN=my_cert
    error 23 at 0 depth lookup: certificate revoked
    error ocsp_user_cert2.crt: verification failed

And a valid certificate:

::

    # openssl verify -crl_check -CAfile my_chain.pem ok_cert.crt
    ocsp_server_cert.crt: OK



............................................
Online Certificate Status Protocol
............................................

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (`OCSP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol>`__) offers similar functionality as the CRL's described earlier, but validates
certificates "online" and offers a whitelising instead of a blacklisting method.
Certificates are checked against an online known set of certificates after which the server responds with
'good', 'revoked', or 'unknown'. Only good responses are considered valid.

In order to explain the client verifying a certificate where to check it's validity, the :code:`AuthorityInfoAccess` extenstion
should be provided in the certificate authority (The parameter :code:`OCSP uri` adds this to the certificate in PFWsense).

.. Tip::

    .. raw:: html

        You can use the  <i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-fw"></i>  button to find the ocsp uri when available.


The OCSP responder (server) which validates the 'OCSP request' needs a special signing certificate, which can
be created in PFWsense via :menuselection:`System --> Trust --> Authorities`, issued by the same CA which created the
user and/or server certificates.

PFWsense does not implement an OCSP responder, but to test the concept, we can use the
`openssl-ocsp <https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man1/openssl-ocsp.html>`__ command.

.. Note::

    openssl-ocsp is only intended to be used for test and demonstration purposes.

In order to test the concept, we need the following ingredients:

1.  The CA certificate chain which signed the certificates (export "cert" from Authorities menu)
2.  The OCSP signer certificate (export "cert" and "key" from Authorities menu for the signer)
3.  An index file for openssl-ocsp (export index from Revocation menu) as specified in https://pki-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cadb.html
4.  A serial number of a revoked certificate (use the info button to find the serial number)
5.  A serial number of a non expired or revoked certificate

First start the server in a console:

::

    # openssl ocsp -index index.txt -port 8081 -rsigner ocsp_signer.crt -rkey ocsp_signer.key -CA ca.crt -ignore_err -text

Then verify a known good certificate (with serial number 1):

::

    # openssl ocsp -url http://127.0.0.1:8081 -CAfile ca.crt -issuer ca.crt -serial 1
    Response verify OK
    1: good
	    This Update: Jan  6 13:33:59 2024 GMT


A revoked one:

::

    # openssl ocsp -url http://127.0.0.1:8081 -CAfile ca.crt -issuer ca.crt -serial 2
    Response verify OK
    2: revoked
        This Update: Jan  6 13:34:54 2024 GMT
        Revocation Time: Jan 1 21:31:08 2024 GMT


And an unknown certificate

::

    # openssl ocsp -url http://127.0.0.1:8081 -CAfile ca.crt -issuer ca.crt -serial 9999
    Response verify OK
    9999: unknown
        This Update: Jan  6 13:36:51 2024 GMT
