24.1  "Savvy Shark" Series
===========================================================================================



For more than 9 years now, PFWsense is driving innovation through
modularising and hardening the open source firewall, with simple
and reliable firmware upgrades, multi-language support, fast adoption
of upstream software updates as well as clear and stable 2-Clause BSD
licensing.

24.1, nicknamed "Savvy Shark", features ports-based OpenSSL 3, Suricata 7,
several MVC/API conversions, a new neighbor configuration feature for ARP/NDP,
core inclusion of the os-firewall and os-wireguard plugins, CARP VHID tracking
for OpenVPN and WireGuard, functional Kea DHCPv4 server with HA support plus
much more.

24.1.1 (February 06, 2024)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Apart from rolling back Suricata 7 to 6 the new major version is looking good.
The two intertwined Suricata default config changes in version 7 have been
identified and fixed in the development version so that we can move back to
version 7 in 24.1.2.

This minor release is intended as a small round of fixes and third party
updates to ensure reliability and security.

Here are the full patch notes:

* system: enable OpenSSL legacy provider by default to allow Google Drive backup to continue working with OpenSSL 3
* system: bring back the interface statistics dashboard widget update interval
* system: fix all items in the PFWsense container being synced in XMLRCP when NAT option is selected
* interfaces: overview page UX improvements
* firewall: align GeoIP file check with documentation
* firewall: fix virtual IP API use with subnet/subnet_bits usage
* wireguard: allow instances to start their ID at 0 like they used to a long time ago
* dhcp: omit faulty comma in Kea config when control agent is disabled
* dhcp: add opt-out automatic firewall rules for Kea server access
* ipsec: remove AEAD algorithms without a PRF for IKE proposals in connections
* openvpn: fix cso_login_matching being ignored during authentication
* backend: optimise stream_handler to exit and kill running process when no listener is attached

A hotfix release was issued as 24.1_1:

* ports: revert back to suricata 6.0.15 for the time being

Migration notes, known issues and limitations:

* Audits and certifications are requiring us to restrict system accounts for non-administrators (without wheel group in particular).  It will no longer be able to use non-adminstrator accounts with shell access and permissions for sensitive files have been tightened to not be world-readable.  This may cause custom tooling to stop working, but can easily be fixed by giving these required accounts the full administration rights.
* ISC DHCP functionality is slowly being deprecated with the introduction of Kea as an alternative.  The work to replace the tooling of ISC DHCP is ongoing, but feature sets will likely differ for a long time therefore.
* The move to the FreeBSD ports version of OpenSSL 3.0 is included and may disrupt third party repository use until those have been fixed and rebuilt accordingly.  Please note that we do not vet third party repositories and do not have control over them so their response time may vary.
* The Squid web proxy functionality moves to a plugin and will no longer be installed by default for new installations. However, if you have Squid enabled the plugin will automatically be installed during the upgrade.  There is no code difference in the implementation and integration of the plugin compared to the core version.
